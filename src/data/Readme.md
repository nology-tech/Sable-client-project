This is the mock data that will be used for now.

The mock data is an object with multiple array.

- Clients
- Resources
- Staff Members
- Resource Requests
- Bookings

To access the data, import the datafile in your page and use `mockData.ARRAY_NEEDED`. (ie. mockData.clients to get all the clients)
You can then, use the data depending on your needs. (ie for the client name: `mockData.clients[0].firstName` <!--output = Mariah --> )
