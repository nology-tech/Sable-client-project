# How to use the Booking Overview

## Calendar

The calendar is has been installed from a package called react-calendar, to use it please refer to the [documentation](https://github.com/wojtekmaj/react-calendar). We also use the react date-picker [(see here)](https://github.com/wojtekmaj/react-date-picker)

If you need to use the date from the calendar, please use the `day` variable in the useState on line 12 of BookingOverview.jsx.

It will be updated everytime someone picks a date, in the calendar or the date picker.
